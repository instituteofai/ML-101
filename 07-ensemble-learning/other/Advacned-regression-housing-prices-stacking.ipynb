Several people have already asked me, by e-mail or in the presentations I made, about ensembles. This is an important issue not only for competitions, but also for real cases where you want to extract as much performance as possible from the models.\n\nEnsembles are sets of models that offer better performance than each model that composes it.\n\nSo in this article I want to exemplify the best way I know of creating ensembles: stacking. This is a method I have used in all competitions that have had good results.\n\nBefore you begin, a tip: It's important to think of Machine Learning as \"processes.\" Here we will not only test models in a database, but we will test processes, pipelines of methods applied to the data to know what the results are.\n\nThis material is part of the presentation I will make (or did) on 30/11 at the PyData Meetup São Paulo.

The training and test data can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/\n\nSomething very important is to explore the data for ideas of features and methods to validate the models. As the focus of this material is stacking, I'll skip this part. Nevertheless, I think it is important to clarify that we have two basic types of variables in this data: categorical and numerical.\n\nCategorical variables have levels that can not be ordered. In some cases it is possible to think of ways to order them, as a variable that describes whether a street is paved or not. In this case one can think that the paved street will value the property.\n\nNumeric variables can receive any continuous value. An example would be the size of the terrain.\n\nIn this cell we load the data and create a DataFrame with the features (X) and a Series with the sale price (SalePrice, y) that is our

It is possible to think of this error as an approximation of the percentage error of the model, but with more interesting properties from the mathematical point of view.\n\nI created three functions to calculate the error. We are going to do transformations of the variable y, so to make our work easier, I decided to create custom functions for each transformation, thus avoiding some confusion when transforming them to compute the error in a single function.\n\nTo use some Scikit-learn functions that will help keep our code cleaner and more efficient, we need to create the error functions in the way that the module requires. In this case, the pecse function receives a trained model, the features and the target. It computes the predictions and should return a number, which is the value of the error metric.\n\nThe last cell line creates a cross-validation object from scikit-learn. He will take care of dividing the data for us. This subject deserves a number of articles, but basically it is a way to divide the data into N parts, and repeatedly use N-1 parts as training data, and the remaining part as test data. For example, if we have the parts [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], in one of the iterations we can train using parts [1, 2, 3, 4] and validate in part 5.\n\nAlthough this is a time series, Kaggle has decided to treat as independent random data, so we will do this simple cross validation.","metadata":{"cell_id":"8c1274b4-3d3c-4c84-8d64-39623d87b0b2"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"cell_id":"060413a4-b9e2-49df-bea8-1d5de8cc3cd7"},"source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, cross_val_predict, KFold\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n\ndef rmsle(estimator, X, y):\n    p = estimator.predict(X)\n    return np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(np.log1p(y), np.log1p(p)))\n\ndef rmsle_log_y(estimator, X, y):\n    p = estimator.predict(X)\n    return np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y, p))\n\ndef rmsle_sqrt_y(estimator, X, y):\n    p = estimator.predict(X)\n    y = np.power(y, 2)\n    p = np.power(p, 2)\n    return np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(np.log1p(y), np.log1p(p)))\n\nkf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature set 1: \"numeric\" variables\n\nThe first set of features we will have will be a simple selection of the originally numeric data variables.

Already in this part I want to train a model of Random Forest inside the cross-validation, to know how it would leave alone in the original data. For this I used the cross_val_score function.

We see that it brings a significant improvement, capturing better the patterns of the relationship between the variables and the sale price of the real estate.","metadata":{"cell_id":"a0b083ae-3611-4d58-a54c-0f6e17b2905e"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"7c92e256-49f5-498a-b80b-e73bacd42588"},"source":"from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n                \nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0)\nerror = cross_val_score(model, X1, np.log1p(y), cv=kf, scoring=rmsle_log_y).mean()\nprint('GBM, X1, log-target RMSLE:', error)\n\nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0)\nerror = cross_val_score(model, X2, np.log1p(y), cv=kf, scoring=rmsle_log_y).mean()\nprint('GBM, X2, log-target RMSLE:', error)","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"021c6e28-df0c-437d-8480-92908f122bb4"},"source":"from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n                \nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0)\nerror = cross_val_score(model, X1, np.sqrt(y), cv=kf, scoring=rmsle_sqrt_y).mean()\nprint('GBM, X1, sqrt-target RMSLE:', error)\n\nmodel = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0)\nerror = cross_val_score(model, X2, np.sqrt(y), cv=kf, scoring=rmsle_sqrt_y).mean()\nprint('GBM, X2, sqrt-target RMSLE:', error)","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Adjusting hyperparameters","metadata":{"cell_id":"8cf2d809-575f-459e-9308-710f49d73a10"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To simplify the example and focus on the ensemble part, I will not adjust the hyperparameters of the model. Hyperparameters are the attributes of the model (such as the depth of the decision trees) that need to be adjusted using separate validation data or a cross-validation cycle.\n\nIt is good to know that not always the best models form the best ensembles. It is important to have powerful models when stacking, but we must also remember that it is important to have diversity. Sometimes some models that have a higher error can capture different patterns of the best models and therefore contribute to the ensemble.\n\nIf you decide to adjust the hyperparameters, it is important to place it within the cross-validation cycle that we will see in the next step.","metadata":{"cell_id":"d660aa5f-523b-425a-8906-69220efb09fe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Stacking\n\nAll we did above is so we can create our ensemble. This is the time to put together the methods used to improve the predictive power of our models.\n\nStacking is a way of doing the ensemble in which we use models to make predictions, and then we use these predictions as features in new models, in what can be called the \"second level.\" You can do this process several times, but at each level the return on performance with respect to the required computation is less.\n\nIn this phase we need two cycles of cross-validation: external and internal. Inside, we will train the models on the original data and make the predictions. On the outside, we will train the model using the first step predictions as features.\n\nAt each step of internal cross validation, we will save the predictions for the part of the data that is used as validation. This way we will have predictions for all examples of our training data. In addition, we will train a model in the original training data so that we can make predictions for the test data.\n\nIn the external cycle we will train a model in the predictions generated by the internal cycle, and the features of the validation data will be the predictions of the first level models in the test data.\n\nIn our specific case, we will create predictions using all combinations of models (RF and GBM), target (log and square root) transformations and feature sets (X1 and X2). We will not use X3 because it would take a lot of time to train, and for the purposes of demonstrating the method these two will be enough.\n\nIn the end we will have predictions of 8 models in the first level. In the second level I used a regularized linear regression (Ridge). Having these predictions we can compute the error in the data outside of our internal training and validation samples, which will give us a reliable estimate of the ensemble error.","metadata":{"cell_id":"576edc5e-bb7e-49e7-8e8b-ed5e391c8db0"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cell_id":"dfbbf102-1ce9-44ec-8203-007df412892c"},"source":"from itertools import product\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\n\nkf_out = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=1)\nkf_in = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=2)\n\ncv_mean = []\nfor fold, (tr, ts) in enumerate(kf_out.split(X, y)):\n    X1_train, X1_test = X1.iloc[tr], X1.iloc[ts]\n    X2_train, X2_test = X2.iloc[tr], X2.iloc[ts]\n    y_train, y_test = y.iloc[tr], y.iloc[ts]\n    \n    modelos = [GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0), RandomForestRegressor(random_state=0)]\n    targets = [np.log1p, np.sqrt]\n    feature_sets = [(X1_train, X1_test), (X2_train, X2_test)]\n    \n    \n    predictions_cv = []\n    predictions_test = []\n    for model, target, feature_set in product(modelos, targets, feature_sets):\n        predictions_cv.append(cross_val_predict(model, feature_set[0], target(y_train), cv=kf_in).reshape(-1,1))\n        model.fit(feature_set[0], target(y_train))\n        ptest = model.predict(feature_set[1])\n        predictions_test.append(ptest.reshape(-1,1))\n    \n    predictions_cv = np.concatenate(predictions_cv, axis=1)\n    predictions_test = np.concatenate(predictions_test, axis=1)\n    \n    stacker = Ridge()\n    stacker.fit(predictions_cv, np.log1p(y_train))\n    error = rmsle_log_y(stacker, predictions_test, np.log1p(y_test))\n    cv_mean.append(error)\n    print('RMSLE Fold %d - RMSLE %.4f' % (fold, error))\n    \nprint('RMSLE CV5 %.4f' % np.mean(cv_mean))\n    \n","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, our best first level model is the GBM trained with the log transformation in the X2 data, which reaches the error of 0.1298.
